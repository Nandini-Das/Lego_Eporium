                <h2>Comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases:</h2>
                <p>SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. <br /> SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. <br />
                A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database </p>
