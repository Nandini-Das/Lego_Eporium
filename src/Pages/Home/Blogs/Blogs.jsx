        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is an Access Token and Refresh Token?</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
        Access token and refresh token are commonly used in web applications for authentication and authorization purposes. 
          An access token is a credential that is issued to a user after successful authentication. It contains information about the user's identity and permissions, and it is used to access protected resources or perform certain actions on behalf of the user.
          On the other hand, a refresh token is a long-lived token that is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate. It is typically used when the access token expires or becomes invalid. 
          The refresh token is securely stored on the client-side, usually in an HTTP-only cookie or local storage, and is sent to the server to request a new access token when needed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">Storage on the Client-Side: Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access. Common storage options include:
         
         HTTP-only Cookies: Storing tokens as HTTP-only cookies provides a secure way to handle them. Cookies are automatically sent with each request, and their HTTP-only attribute prevents them from being accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
         
         Browser's Web Storage: Tokens can be stored in the browser's local storage or session storage. However, extra caution should be taken as these storages are susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It is recommended to store tokens in an encrypted format or use frameworks that handle security measures.
         
         In-Memory Storage: Storing tokens in memory is an option, but it is not recommended for long-lived sessions. In-memory storage is volatile, and tokens will be lost if the user refreshes or closes the browser.</p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Comparing SQL and NoSQL Databases</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
        SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of databases with distinct characteristics.
          SQL databases are relational databases that use tables to store data and enforce a predefined schema. They use SQL for querying and managing data. SQL databases provide strong consistency, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and are suitable for complex relationships and structured data.
          NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that provide flexible schemas and can store unstructured or semi-structured data. They use various data models like key-value, document, column-family, or graph. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, have high availability, and are suitable for handling large amounts of data with high read and write throughput.
          The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the nature of the data, scalability needs, and the need for complex querying or transaction

        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is Express.js?</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
        Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and minimalist approach to building web applications and APIs. Express.js offers a set of robust features and middleware that allow developers to easily handle HTTP requests, manage routes, handle cookies, and implement various authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
          With its flexibility and extensive ecosystem, Express.js has become one of the most widely used frameworks for building web applications with Node.js. It allows developers to quickly prototype and build scalable and efficient server-side applications.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
        MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for performing data aggregation operations on collections of documents. It allows you to process and transform data, perform complex queries, and generate customized results.
    The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB consists of stages that sequentially process the documents. Each stage performs a specific operation on the input documents and passes the result to the next stage.
    The stages in the aggregation pipeline can include operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, projecting, and performing calculations. It also supports a wide range of operators and functions to manipulate and transform the data.
    Aggregation in MongoDB provides powerful capabilities for data analysis and reporting. It can handle large volumes of data efficiently and allows you to perform complex queries and transformations in a single operation. It is particularly useful when dealing with real-time analytics, data mining, and business intelligence applications.
